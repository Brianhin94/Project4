# Project4 Color Wheel!
# Team Brian!

## Every developer LOVES front end styling right? However it might not always be so easy to find the exact color hash youre looking for. I thought id take a dive into learning Vue.js 3 by making a color wheel app!


### Tech stack included!
Vue.js!
Vue-color



### Essentially this will be a single page app that allows you to scroll a color wheel and see the hash code for it change so that you may copy the code to use in your own projects!



How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology? I plan on using guides online for tips and guidance to help with the logic and implimentation of Vue-color
What is your goal with this project? Allow developers to easily find color hashes through the help of my self promotion!
Who is the user for your app? Newer Developers
Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into? Stress!

2. Learn more about vue.js3 in general
3. Begin to impliment vue in a basic app.
4. More looking in to vue-color!
