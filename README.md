# Project4

## Every developer LOVES front end styling right? However it might not always be so easy to find the exact color hash youre looking for. I thought id take a dive into learning Vue.js 3 by making a color wheel app!


### Tech stack included!
Vue.js!
Vue-color



### Essentially this will be a single page app that allows you to scroll a color wheel and see the hash code for it change so that you may copy the code to use in your own projects!
